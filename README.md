# XCS Classifier System with Theoretical Parameter Settings for C#

This is an open source code of the XCS [learning classifier system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_classifier_system) for binary- and real-valued inputs (i.e., ternary alphabet and ordered-bound hyperrectangular representation are employed as a rule antecedent, respectively) written in C# using theoretical parameter settings. This code is based on XCS-Java given by Martin V. Butz:

``
Butz, M. V. (2000). XCSJava 1.0: An Implementation of the XCS classiÂ£ er system in Java. Technical Report 2000027, Illinois Genetic Algorithms Laboratory
``

Note that, for speeding up, this code employs the "messy-coding" like rule-matching process with paralell computing, which returns the same result of normal matching process.

## What is XCS?
XCS stands for Accuracy-Based Learning Classifier System (or eXtended Classifier System), a classification framework based on a reinforcement learning technique. It seeks to form accurate, maximally general rules that together classify the state space of a given domain. The framework uses an accuracy-based fitness to provide a natural pressure to produce maximally accurate rules. In contrast, a rule-reduction method, i.e., the subsumption operator, allows pressure to extract the maximally general rules. The cooperative cycle with both pressures enables XCS to eventually retain the maximally accurate and general rules if the evolutionary computation methods can generate them. 

## The Power of Our Learning Optimality Theory
XCS have been applied to modern issues in the machine learning field. We have derived a theoretical approach that mathematically guarantees that XCS identifies maximally accurate rules in the fewest iterations possible, which also returns a theoretically valid hyperparameter setting. We also experimentally show that our theoretical setting enables XCS to easily solve several challenging problems where it had previously struggled. This contribution has been published on IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation.



## How to Run

 1. Open "xcs_coding.sln" with Microsoft Visual Studio.

 2. Decide which problem to solve from "xcs_binary_coding/Program.cs" for binary-valued inputs or "xcs_realvalue_coding/Program.cs" for real-valued inputs.

 3. Run with or without debug
